# Workshop of microbiome dataset analysis using MicrobiotaProcess

# Instructors name and contact information

  - Shuangbin Xu: <xshuangbin@163.com>
  - Guangchuang Yu: <guangchuangyu@gmail.com>

# Workshop description

This workshop focuses on the bioinformatics analysis of `microbiome`.
Specifically, we will demonstrate how to perform downstream analysis
(after OTU picking) using `MicrobiotaProcess` and `phyloseq`.

## Pre-requisites

  - Basic knowledge of R syntax.
  - General understanding of `Amplicon` analysis or have strong
    interests.
  - Familiarity with some `bioconductor` objects or `S4` class.
  - A computer that runs on Unix-like system.

## *R* / *Bioconductor* packages used

  - [MicrobiotaProcess](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/MicrobiotaProcess.html)
  - [phyloseq](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phyloseq.html)
  - [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
  - [ggtree](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html)
  - [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html)
